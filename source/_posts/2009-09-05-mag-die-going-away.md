going away
meg&amp;dia
Please don't forget me, I'm going away.
I'm taking a taxi to Kentucky,
Where they don't even know
All about me; I just need to feel safe.
I've got a thousand sweaters, and shoes,
And paintings to hide;
The skeletons in my way, don't ask where I'm going
I'm going away, I'm going my way.
Finally, it's my time, to be lonely enough. unloved and I can't wait.
Dont forget what I said, don't forget my letter.
Every night I pray for you.
I don't got a religion. Isnt that something? I miss those days.
I see that bottle, it's now ten years aged.
I've got the marbles I could sell for money, got a pair of fresh shaved legs.
Won't you baby come with me?
I've got a extra space
In my car, in my heart, in my mind
Look there's the passenger seat by the boat that you gave
Don't know where I'm going...
I'm going away, I'm going my way.
finally it's my time, to be lonely enough. unloved and I can't wait.
Don't forget what I said; don't forget my letter.
Every night I pray for you,
I don't got a religion. Isnt that something? I miss those days.
Well he said, slow down; slow down;
Think it over, weve all got wretched closets.
A silly girl pride kills more than AIDS
Lately I say come on, I've thought it over,
I don't wanna die here; I've no desire to get married.
I can't read the others anymore.
Alone, I must learn to race myself
I'm going away, I'm going my way
Finally it's my time, to be lonely enough. Unloved and I can't wait
please forget what I said, please forget my letter.
Every night I pray for you;
I don't got a religion to think that something will make those days.
I, I'm not going halfway (I'll find my way)
I, I, Every night I pray for you,
Don't believe in Heaven or that it could be a happy place
I,
I'm going away
