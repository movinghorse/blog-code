<p>　　歌手姓名：Hollywood Undead&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　推荐歌曲：<span style="color: #ff0000">The Diary</span></p>
<p>　　唱片公司：A&amp;M Records&nbsp;</p>
<p>　　专辑流派：Hard Rock/Hip Hop / Alternative / Screamo &nbsp;</p>
<p>　　专辑简介：这支好莱坞贫民窟走出来的乐队，05年建队时有7人，后shady jeff 退出，现为6人乐队。成员均戴着面具，以掩饰他们的真实身份，这点与slipknot相同。他们有着自己鲜明的个性：糅合了hip hop, emo 和metal风格，以吼叫嗓音+和谐的吉他旋律+快节奏的riff让人为之振奋，拖着情绪朋克和鞭笞金属的小影子，却大受人们喜爱。2005年6月3日，他们在MySpace上建了网页，上传几首重金属与hip -hop混合的原创音乐作品。很快，每天几百条评论、几千个&ldquo;添加为好友&rdquo;的请求、几万次的点击率，使他们登上了MySpace乐队排行榜，从第十二名跃到第一，许多全球知名的乐队都成了他们的手下败将。同时他们也是Myspace签下的第一个乐队。然而为了这debut album（处女专辑）H.U.却用了三年时间。</p>
<p>cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home <br />
cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home <br />
I **in' swear that I care <br />
but its hard when you stare <br />
into the bottom of a bottle <br />
that is empty and bare <br />
all my desolate soul <br />
in my desolate home <br />
it's my desolate role <br />
yeah I'm here all alone <br />
I can't think of a reason <br />
to get the ** out of bed <br />
curtains closed, lights are off <br />
Am I alive or dead? <br />
I haven't shaved in a week <br />
I always slur when I speak <br />
tolerance at its peak <br />
another fit just to sleep <br />
oh woe is me woe is me <br />
I guess I need love <br />
hoes ya see hoes ya see <br />
I'm just in a rut <br />
and I swear I'm tryin baby please <br />
Baby don't leave <br />
god-damn I'm a **-up <br />
But I guess that's just me <br />
so I sit in my room <br />
and I'll cry in my bed <br />
thinkin about all the shit <br />
that made me wrong in my head <br />
I keep tryin to climb <br />
but it seems so steep <br />
pour myself a **in' whisky <br />
and go back to sleep.... bitch <br />
cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home <br />
cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home <br />
I watch my momma cry <br />
she says 'baby why?' <br />
I say 'baby died, <br />
baby's gone like a suicide' <br />
I don't think you'll see him soon, mom <br />
stay out my room, mom <br />
tell daddy that I hate <br />
that mother **er like you, mom <br />
I sing this shit for you, Danny, Sasha and Jordan <br />
these tears keep gettin warmer <br />
everytime that I hold her <br />
I pour this out for you <br />
like a partner in crime <br />
it's part of the times <br />
when you're sick in the mind <br />
yeah I'm sick, oh so sick <br />
I'm so sick of this shit <br />
Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit <br />
I'm so **ed up off it <br />
so I stumble around <br />
til I stumble fall down <br />
to this puddle of my tears <br />
layin here on the ground <br />
when you've got nothing left <br />
you've got nothing left to lose <br />
with my last left single breath <br />
I'll still be singing to you <br />
so when you bury me man <br />
you better bury me deep <br />
and sing along to this song <br />
because you're broken like me <br />
cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home <br />
cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home <br />
And I wanna go back to the start <br />
back where we started from <br />
and I know it's been so long <br />
I was wrong, I was wrong <br />
I was wrong all along <br />
And I wanna go back to the start <br />
back where we started from <br />
and I know it's been so long <br />
I was wrong, I was wrong <br />
I was wrong all along <br />
cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home <br />
cus I don't wanna be like this <br />
I've been runnin these streets <br />
for too long now <br />
I've got nothing thats true <br />
but this song now <br />
but the further I go <br />
I wanna go home<br />
